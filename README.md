- Sup, I'm Alex, although I mainly use my nickname "ByteBite" online.
- Most of my projects are either for hobbies or for school.
- If you're checking this GitHub page from my research paper, I'll be glad to answer any questions if you have them. Just email me and I'll answer in my free time (^_^)
- Hope y'all have a great day!
